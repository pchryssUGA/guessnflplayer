guessnflplayer is a Full-Stack web application where users can test their knowledge of NFL rosters by typing the 
name of a player whose image is generated on their screen. To build this project, I used a variety of technologies 
such as Python, HTML+CSS, AWS Services, SQLite, APIs, Pandas web-scraping, and Bootstrap. In the future, I have
plans to incorporate statistical modeling and machine learning to predict how likely a player is to be guessed correctly!
